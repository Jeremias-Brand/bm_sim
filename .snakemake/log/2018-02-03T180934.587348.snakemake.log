Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 73 of /Users/jeremias/Dropbox/Bioinformatics/Reports/bm_sim/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
1lelfile
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job tre_sim since they might be corrupted:
out/simulated_trees_info.tsv
Will exit after finishing currently running jobs.
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
